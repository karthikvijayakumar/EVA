Algorithm reaches first target at 0:22, second target at 4:43 and the last target at 6:20

The car uses 9 sensors to understand where it is aat any point. The sensors are located at 5,10 and 20 pixels from the car at orientations -30,0 and +30 wrt to the velocty of the car.

The reward function is dependent on the distance of the car from the goal. The closer the car gets to the goal, the more reward it gets.
